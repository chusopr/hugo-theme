# Chuso Theme for Hugo

This is a clean, elegant, but fully functional blog theme for Hugo. Here is a live [demo site](https://chuso.net) using this theme.  

It is based [cleanwhite theme](https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite) which is at the same time based on [huxblog Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io)
and [Clean Blog Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

This theme is basically a fork of _cleanwhite_ theme with some customizations made for my site [chuso.net](https://chuso.net).
